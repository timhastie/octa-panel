# Measured on a part the UNIT had written (every track FILTER + DELAY, the

# EIGHT tracks read FILTER's page-2 descriptor defaults (00 00 01 00 03 00)

# their rows at exactly 0x367 and 0x3c1 = 0x307 + 6 + 30 * track. Page 1 IS
# 24 from 0x12f (the same part reads eight identical rows).
#
# ⚠️ TWO WRONG LAYOUTS SHIPPED IN ONE DAY. The 24-stride writes landed in
# other tracks' rows (the stock DELAY's DIR, its dry level, read 0 on T2/T4/
# T7: silent until re-selected). The first fix, 0x325 + 30 * track, was
# ONE BLOCK LATE: it wrote every track's page 2 into the NEXT track's block,
# so T4's DELAY row landed on T5's BusVerb (DIFF 127: the tank self-
# oscillates and nothing but a reboot stops it) and T2's on T3's character
# station (RING 127). Seven tracks decoding right under 0x325 was the trap:
# a stride fits at any phase that lands on rows the unit happened to have
# written the same way. What settled it was a write the unit made on a
# NAMED track. Falsifier now: a unit re-select on track t whose row is not
# at 0x307 + 30 * (t - 1) (+6 for FX2).

# PATTERN DATA: the sequencer's own records, and the step masks at their head
#
# A bank file is IFF: sixteen `PTRN` chunks (file stride 0x8eec), each holding
# eight `TRAC` sub-chunks (file stride 0x922) for the audio tracks and then
# eight `MTRA` for the MIDI ones. Every chunk is tag+len, so a record's DATA
# starts 8 bytes past its tag -- which is why the RAM strides are 8 less
# (0x8ed8 per pattern, 0x91a per track: `mulsl #0x91a,%d7` at 0x4009d376 and
# its siblings, with d7 = track).
#
# A TRAC record begins with a run of 64-bit big-endian STEP MASKS at an
# 8-byte stride: bit (step-1), so byte 7 bit 0 = step 1. Mask 0x00 is the
# note/sample trig -- the one `emu_rtos.poke_trig` sets in RAM, and the one
# whose bits you can read straight out of a real project (the rig project's
# track 1 reads 0x0001000100010001: trigs on steps 1, 17, 33 and 49).
# ✅ END TO END: setting step 2 here, on disk, with no RAM poke at all,
# lands `0xd3` on track 0 at frame 344 -- byte, track and frame identical to
# what `--poke-trig 2` produces, which is M6c's own fidelity gate.
# The sequencer ORs
# 0x00/0x08/0x10/0x18 for its "anything on this step" test (0x4009d382..9a)
# and builds a per-track flag word from 0x20 -> bit 12, 0x28 -> bit 13,
# 0x30 -> bit 14, 0x38 -> bits 5+8 (0x4009d93c..0x4009da12).
#
# ⚠️ WHICH MASK IS THE RECORDER TRIG IS NOT KNOWN. 0x40/0x48 are not masks at
# all -- they read as a run of 0xaa, a default-filled per-step byte array.
# The cheap way to settle it is `pattern-diff` below against two projects
# saved from the unit, one with a recorder trig and one without; nothing in
# the emulator identifies it as directly.
