BUS.md tasks 11 + 13: the full three-entry FX2 menu, both payloads, with the
three servers' own DSP code actually placed and dispatched.

    python3 tools/build/build_bus.py

Builds on tools/build/build_menu.py's already-verified ColdFire menu tables (same
constants, reproduced here rather than imported so this stays a single
self-contained build script like every other tools/build_*.py in this
project) and adds what task 11 explicitly deferred: placing
the selected modules' assembled DSP code (modules/<name>/*.asm)
in real P memory, for BOTH payloads, and repointing X:0x215/X:0x235 so the
three new ids (0x01 DELAY SERVER, 0x02 REVERB SERVER, 0x03 SEND) actually run
them instead of whatever the byte-donor used to be.

DSP-side donor choice (P-code space only -- unrelated to the ColdFire
descriptor-clone donors task 11 already picked).

**v98: CHORUS IS NO LONGER A DONOR AND IS FULLY RESTORED.** All three servers
now pack into the PLATE + SPRING + DARK region alone -- 2724 contiguous words
against the code (2,692 words as of 11 Aug 2026 -- the build report is the live number), so everything fits in space that was already spent on
replacing the three stock reverbs. SEND used to sit in CHORUS's 329-word
module, which cost FX1 its chorus to house 166 words; that was collateral,
not a considered trade. The three reverbs are the trade: we replaced them
with a better one.

Layout, in address order from PLATE's base:

  SEND           166 words
  REVERB SERVER 1999
  DELAY SERVER   507   <- last DELIBERATELY: BusDelay is the algorithm still
                          to be designed, so it gets the trailing free words
                          (see the build report for the live count) and is
                          adjacent to COMPRESSOR's module if
                          the region is ever extended rightward. Growing it
                          then moves nothing else.

The three records are contiguous in LOADED P memory but separated by headers
in the file, so a stream spanning them is split per record on the way in --
the technique tools/build/build_reverb.py proved on hardware for SPRING+DARK, just
generalised to three. Contiguity is asserted at build time rather than
assumed.

**Donor ids get repointed to the SAME null stub tools/build/build_dspprobe.py
already used and proved silent on hardware (P:0x007c8/0x007c9 payload A,
P:0x00588/0x00589 payload B -- stock DELAY's own dispatch, already a no-op
by design), not to the new server code.** This is a deliberate departure
from tools/build/build_reverb.py, which repoints SPRING/DARK's own ids at the new
reverb engine -- fine there because nothing else in this project offers
those ids any more once this build's three-entry menu replaces the whole FX2
chooser. The FX1 menu never listed the reverbs or DELAY -- they are FX2-only
(Sam, corrected repeatedly; do not write "FX1 selecting PLATE..." again) --
so no selector should ever reach the donor ids. The null stub is defensive
insurance for exactly that assumption: if ANY dispatch path did resolve a
donor id (a saved part, an id poked by something we haven't mapped), pointing
it at our servers would run the SAME hardcoded-Y-base engine a second,
uncontrolled time on whatever track holds it -- the multi-instance collision
the hardcoded-base design assumes can't happen (BUS.md's Memory section).
Silencing them makes any such path harmless silence, the same
already-hardware-proven behaviour stock DELAY has always had.

CHORUS (id 0x12) is deliberately NOT in that list any more. Its code is
untouched and its dispatch entries keep the values the stock image ships, so
FX1 selecting CHORUS gets the real chorus back. Nothing has to be restored
to make that work -- every build starts from a pristine
out/raw/section_3_MAIN_OS.bin, so the stock code was never destroyed, only
overwritten on the way out.

The shared-window Y base is the one place this script differs per payload in
the ASSEMBLED CODE itself (not just where it's placed). Payload A's half of
the 64K shared window is 0x30000-0x37FFF and payload B's is 0x38000-0x3FFFF,
so `_sub` (below) rewrites the literal `$30000` to PP[tag]["ybase"] in the
source text before assembling.

⚠️ It is a BLANKET string replace over the whole source, not a single
targeted occurrence, and under XBUS it is applied to SEND and REVERB SERVER
as well as DELAY SERVER. Two consequences:

  - Any of those files that wants a shared-window address which must NOT
    move to the other half on payload B cannot spell it `$30000`. Use an
    offset from a register-held base, or a literal that is not `$30000`.
  - It rewrites comment text too. Harmless, but do not read a disassembly
    comment as evidence of what was substituted.

✅ Verified in the emitted image 9 Aug 2026 rather than by reading this
code: payload B's placed P words carry 0x38000 five times and 0x30000 zero
times. The old docstring here claimed "exactly one occurrence", which was
never true for the XBUS path.

# BUILD TAG, stamped into the effect's displayed name. Three rounds were lost
# to not being able to tell WHICH build was running on the unit: a symptom
# ("knobs unchanged") is ambiguous between "the change did not work" and "the
# flash did not apply", and those need opposite responses. The name field is
# 13 bytes and always on screen, so it costs nothing to carry the answer.
# BUMP THIS EVERY TIME A .bin IS WRAPPED FOR FLASHING.
# 31 -> 32, 10 Aug 2026: 31 covered BOTH the working 7 Aug flashes and the
# dead R13 flash, which cost a session of "which build is this" -- the exact
# ambiguity this tag exists to prevent. 32 -> 33: the post-marker product
# build (mapping documented, real names under SPEC). 33 -> 34: LFO roll
# + wet makeup, the R15 flash.
# 37 -> 38, 13 Aug 2026: 35-37 were stamped for reverb rounds R16/R17/R18 and
# NONE of them ever reached a card, so 37's contents kept growing under a tag
# that had already been "assigned" -- by the time it was wrapped it also
# carried the whole of BusDelay v2 (five modes, GRAIN through 5g). A tag that
# names two different images is the failure at 31 all over again, so the wrap
# gets a fresh number: 38 == OCTABAMR19 == everything through R18 plus
# BusDelay v2. 35, 36 and 37 were never on hardware and never will be.
# 40 was allocated to the HKB=1 DIAGNOSTIC wrap (OCTABAMR21, 17 Aug) -- an
# image that swaps which payload housekeeps, built as a falsifier and never
# flashed. It is superseded: the race was confirmed for free by moving
# BusDelay between tracks 1 and 4, and the falsifier was weaker than it
# looked anyway (swapping the housekeeper TRANSPOSES the hazard rather than
# removing it). Tag 40 is burned rather than reused, because a tag that names
# two different images is the failure at 31 all over again.
# 41 == OCTABAMR22 == R20 plus the four-buffer cross-core race fix and the
# phantom-client gate. R22 CONFIRMED THE RACE FIX ON HARDWARE (Sam: track 1 is
# clean), and exposed the next defect in the same breath: "the signal is much
# quieter".
# 42 == OCTABAMR23 == R22 plus SEND registering per bus and only when sending.
# ⚠️ THIS ONE IS MUCH LOUDER -- up to +17 dB for a real sender in a sparse
# bank, because idle tracks (which alias to SEND) were each taking a 1/N share.
# Send knobs and track faders set against R22 will be wrong, and BusVerb's
# BIG mode clips at a 0.25-0.5 FS input, so back it off by hand.
# R23 is also the image that FOUND the second cross-core defect: static that
# needed a specific (core-1 track, delay mode) pair, moved when either changed,
# and vanished when track 5 -- core 0's housekeeper -- stopped being a BusVerb.
# 43 == OCTABAMR24 == R23 plus per-core rotation tracking, the fix for it.
# R24 took the artifact from moving across the whole sweep to ONE combination
# in fifteen: T4 sending, delay MODE 1. T4 is the LAST core-1 track and CLEAN
# the cheapest mode, i.e. where core 1 runs furthest ahead of core 0.
# ⚠️ R25 SHIPPED A COLD-BOOT BUG: the tracked rotation was never initialised,
# and a client booting one step ahead is indistinguishable from one legitimately
# reading pre-flip, so it stuck -- and with the clear moved ahead, a stuck
# client writes exactly the buffer being cleared. Metallic on every power cycle,
# cured by re-selecting the effect. Do not flash 44.
# 45 == OCTABAMR26 == R25 plus seeding that value at init. R26 is the image on
# which Sam swept T2/T3/T4 x MODE 1..5 and found ALL MODES GOOD ON ALL TRACKS
# -- the three cross-core defects are closed.
# 46 == OCTABAMR27 == R26 plus the auto-gain law 1/sqrt(N) instead of 1/N.
# 47 == OCTABAMR28 == R27 plus the page-2 companion-field fix: the companion is
# BITS 8-15, not the low byte. Wakes five knobs that have NEVER worked on
# hardware -- delay WOW/PTCH/FRZE, reverb WIDTH and ->DEL. All five CONFIRMED
# on the unit, 17 Aug.
# 48 == OCTABAMR29 == R28 plus BusVerb v4: the RETURN conversion. The reverb
# now mirrors the delay -- wet-only output, MIX -> IN (default 0), host counted
# as a client only while sending. ⚠️ A reverb track with audio and IN=0 is
# SILENT by design; reverb level rides the track fader now. Ear-passed by Sam
# on hardware, 17 Aug ("sounds pretty good").
# 49 == OCTABAMR30 == R29 plus -VRB: the delay's ->VERB send is a KNOB again
# (p5, default 0, registration follows it). ⚠️ NO WASH out of the box until
# -VRB comes up -- and see docs/remixer/FLASHING.md's "first load of an existing
# project" step: old VRBW/MIX values load as -VRB/IN.
# 50 == OCTABAMR31 == R30 minus BusVerb's ->DEL send (the vestige twin of
# VRBD; retired, slot 11 blank). The reverb writes NO bus at all now -- the
# only wet-crossing edge is delay->reverb, under the -VRB knob.
# ⚠️ R30 AND R31 CARRY A BROKEN DELAY IN (the -VRB splice deleted its decode;
# $76 never written). NEITHER WAS FLASHED. Do not flash either; tag 51 fixes.
# ⚠️ R36'S DPTH/RATE/DRV WERE DEAD ON HARDWARE (shared-window Y state at
# 0x360d3-5 -- writes and in-loop reads never meet on silicon; mechanism
# unknown). 56 == OCTABAMR37 == R36 with that state moved to core-private Y
# 0901-0903h (the old bus range). Flash R37; discard R36.
# 55 == OCTABAMR36 == R35 plus DRIVE (p10 = DRV outside GRAIN; loop-stable
# blend toward the 2x curve; default 0 = exact bypass; GRAIN keeps SPRA).
# 54 == OCTABAMR35 == R34 plus the TAPE retirement: DPTH (was WOW) + RATE are
# global modulation across every delay mode; TAPE's position aliases CLEAN
# (bit-identically, knobs matched); saturation keys on DPTH>0.
# 53 == OCTABAMR34 == R33 with BIG's trim softened -6 -> -3 (ear: "a bit of a
# volume drop"; the +8.4 measurement was part-state-inflated).
# 52 == OCTABAMR33 == R32 plus voicing round 1 from the hardware captures:
# BIG wet -6 dB, GRAIN +6 dB, and RATE (MOD speed select, reverb p11).
# 51 == OCTABAMR32 == R31 plus the IN fix and the IN/-VRB slot swap (IN
# bottom-right on BOTH effects: delay IN p4->p5, -VRB p5->p4).
# ⚠️ LOUDER AGAIN with several senders: up to +9 dB at eight tracks of real
# (uncorrelated) material. Correlated content now UNDER-corrects and can clip.
# 44 == OCTABAMR25 == R24 plus clearing the buffer written NEXT block, which
# closes clear-vs-WRITE -- the one hazard of the family still open, and the
# one that pairing is exactly where you would expect to bite.
# ⚠️ The artifact RELOCATES, so testing this needs a SWEEP of track/mode
# combinations. One clean configuration is what let it survive R23.
# 57 == R38 == DIAGNOSTIC (hardwired mod) -- discard. Its result: constants
# changed nothing, which is what exposed that the DEPTH LAW was the "defect".
# 58 == OCTABAMR39 == R37 content plus the x8 depth relaw, per-sample lag
# clamp, 4x drive knee, and the modtap roll. Flash R39; discard R36-R38.
# 59 == OCTABAMR40 == R39 plus the reverb MOD relaw (ROOM x4 / PLATE x2.9 /
# BIG x2) and DRIVE's d relocated to r7+$83 (Y-in-callee measured dead on hw).
# 60 == OCTABAMR41 == R40 plus the drive OUTPUT makeup (wet x (1 + d/2)).
# 66 == OCTABAMR47 == R46 plus the DELAY's IN-keyed wet makeup (23 Aug 2026,
# "delay wet is quiet"): out += 2*IN*wet -- additive from the PRE-drive wet,
# so IN=0 is bit-identical INCLUDING under hot drive (measured: +9.5 dB at
# IN=127, +6.0 at 64, 0.0 at 0). Found and fixed on the way: send_probe's
# --din drove SLOT 4 (-VRB) since the 18 Aug IN/-VRB swap -- the makeup
# measured +0.0 dB until the harness was fixed; verify_delay's SLOT map had
# the same stale 4. verify_bus was correct all along (its DS IN case was the
# real safety net). Fixture dmix 127 -> 40: at 127 the x3 makeup railed
# every D layout and a clipped fixture is a blind fixture.
# 65 == OCTABAMR46 also carries THE BURN-SWEEP UNBLOCK (23 Aug, all
# BIT-IDENTICAL -- placement, not behavior; verified by image-vs-image render
# hashes across every mode/interval/gate state):
#   * phead roll: the PITCH head body (62 words) appeared FOUR times in the
#     delay; rolled -> payload B FREE 220.
#   * md_done hoist: all three reverb modes stored the same five constants
#     (diffuser taps + RATE scale); hoisted past the fork. rp_tail: ROOM and
#     PLATE shared three more ($20/$3f/$73). g_off: one $400000 load now
#     serves GCNT and GHOLD. Payload A FREE 74.
#   * verify_burn: GREEN for the first time -- the burn probe builds fit and
#     all four checks pass; the alias-probe combo alone still needs ~42 words
#     and now SKIPs granularly instead of masking the sweep.
# ⚠️ cycle_count now OVERPRICES the delay by ~264 (it mis-attributes the
# rolled phead calls); actual cycles unchanged. The BURN=1 hardware sweep is
# the real measurement and is READY: TPROBE-style one flash, sweep p3.
# 65 == OCTABAMR46 == R45 plus the GATE threshold fix (23 Aug 2026): the
# trigger bar drops 0.094 -> 0.004 FS (-20.5 -> -48 dBFS). MEASURED defect:
# at GATE>0, material under the old bar rendered the wet DIGITALLY SILENT
# until something crossed -20.5 (a -24 dBFS melody at GATE=12 = pure
# silence); the fixed threshold keeps quiet material alive and the clap
# chop intact (hold unchanged -- the hold is the musical part). ⚠️ Whether
# this silent-wet mode is the R44/R45 field incident is UNRESOLVED: it
# matches every symptom (wet dead / dry passing / sends useless / delay
# fine / re-select cures via GATE=0 defaults), but Sam suspects a
# sequencer/track interaction -- ColdFire-side, investigation PAUSED at
# Sam's request. The incident stays open either way.
# 64 == OCTABAMR45 == R44 plus Sam's R44 hardware feedback (23 Aug 2026):
# wet makeup steepened to x(1 + 2*IN) -- +9.5 dB at full IN ("could still be
# mixed louder"; IN=0 still EXACTLY x1). Measured: percussive wet now 11 dB
# under dry at full IN (was 20 pre-makeup), no clipping; hot SUSTAINED
# material clips the store above IN~90 -- knob territory, documented, not
# guarded (dry ducking was explicitly rejected: "don't back down that
# [crossfade] road"). Shifter-input HP corner 570 -> ~280 Hz, ear-picked
# from a 4-corner wet-only ladder ("second one is good"). ⚠️ OPEN INCIDENT,
# now TWICE on hardware (R44/R45 era): the reverb's WET dies -- dry keeps
# passing, sends into it do nothing -- until the effect is re-selected on
# the track. Sequencer unaffected. NOT double-select (Sam confirmed), NOT
# reproducibly triggered (once correlated with turning SIZE up). Model
# analysis: the only state that PERSISTS like this is "core 0's bus
# housekeeping stopped" -- the role locks then hold a stale owner, every
# instance takes the duplicate exit (rts = dry passthrough) and nobody
# consumes the ACC. The election should self-heal that, so hardware is
# doing something the single-core emulator cannot see. NEXT OCCURRENCE'S
# ONE DIAGNOSTIC: check whether tracks 1-4 sends -> BusDelay ALSO died.
# The same housekeeper serves both buses: delay dead too = housekeeping
# died (mechanism located); delay alive = reverb-instance-local. (The
# duplicate-instance case itself is verified INERT in-model: an RRS layout
# renders stable for 8 s, second instance = clean dry passthrough.)
# 63 == OCTABAMR44 == R43 plus the reverb v7 trio (23 Aug 2026, Sam's picks):
# (1) IN-KEYED WET MAKEUP -- wet x (1 + IN), +6 dB at full IN, EXACTLY x1 at
# IN=0 (the R29 return level is preserved to the bit; measured x1.99 from
# sample one at IN=127). (2) SHFT replaces WIDTH: slot 9 selects the shimmer
# interval +12/+19/+7/-12 via a fractional read phase (core-private 0905h);
# +12 is BIT-IDENTICAL to the R18 shimmer (hash-gated); width is pinned wide
# (the old default). All four intervals verified spectrally on a tone.
# (3) SHIFTER-INPUT HP (the R18 "airier octave" item, unblocked): one-pole,
# corner ~560 Hz, state at 0906h, on the shimmer feed only -- a VOICING
# CONSTANT awaiting Sam's ear (A/B pair rendered). PAID FOR by the apbody
# roll (the input-diffuser allpass body appeared 4x; payload A FREE 18
# after everything). verify-bus restamped: every reverb-analyzed layout
# changed by exactly the makeup (fixture drives IN=127), every
# delay-analyzed layout bit-identical.
# 62 == OCTABAMR43 == R42 plus the FREEZE seam crossfade (v6, 23 Aug 2026):
# engaging FREEZE used to capture a step between the loop's newest and oldest
# sample and replay it every lap (measured with the new DFRZAT repro hook:
# one ~0.14 FS discontinuity per TIME+64 samples on a pure tone, forever).
# The hold's write now crossfades from the live chain into the tap over
# ~1.5 ms at engage (ramp r in core-private Y, armed while running, decaying
# only while frozen), so the captured loop never contains a step; after the
# fade the write is the tap TO THE BIT, so the hold still neither decays nor
# grows. Running path bit-identical (verify_delay all modes + verify-bus
# 19/19, no restamp). PAID FOR by the smoothw roll -- the 17-instruction
# smoothstepped-triangle window appeared five times in the delay (wow,
# flutter, GRAIN, REVERSE x2); rolled to one subroutine, payload B FREE
# 1 -> 51 net. Also fixed: verify_delay's mode_count undercounted since
# TAPE's retirement, so REVERSE was silently skipped by every run since
# 18 Aug -- both REVERSE cases are live again.
# 61 == OCTABAMR42 == R41 plus v5 dry passthrough on BOTH hosts (23 Aug 2026):
# each server's own track prints its dry at unity under the wet, so IN=0 is an
# exact passthrough instead of silence. Bus arithmetic untouched (IN still
# gates engine feed and client registration); GATE still scales wet only. Net
# ZERO words on payload B (the drive-makeup a/b dance collapsed to `add x0,a`),
# +4 on payload A. With a silent host track the output is bit-identical to R41.
# 78 == OCTABAMR62 == tag-77 content plus R61 and R62 (31 Aug 2026):
# R61 = GRAIN density decode fix (the DENS/DPTH gate compared knob>>1
# against a 3-bit draw, so >=15 was always full density; now knob>>4, the
# full dial) + the density MAKEUP (coeff 1/2 + (7-dens3)/14 into the grain
# gain word; level flat +-1.2 dB across the dial, was -7.1 dB of sag).
# R62 = REVERSE size-table indices 0/1 swapped so the panel default
# (PTCH=1) is the 93 ms musical segment, 46 ms on index 0. CLEAN/PITCH/
# REVERSE proven bit-identical through R61, and R62's swap proven an exact
# exchange. ⚠️ Stored parts with DPTH ~48 in GRAIN come up MID density on
# this tag -- the knob working for the first time; the makeup holds level.
# 79 == OCTABAM79 == the BamSep26 rig + THE RETURNS (3 Sep 2026): three
# stations (FILTER/LO-FI/CHORUS replaced, all bus senders), BusDelay v5,
# the Character station returning both wets on the master (RVRB/DLY in
# SAT=BUS), hosts quiet only while a return is live; label formatters
# overflow into the second zero run. Flash 4, docs/effects/FLASHPLAN.md.
# ⚠️ IT FOLLOWS THE MAKEFILE'S `BUILD` (4 Sep 2026). It was a literal here
# and the Makefile's BUILD chose the FILENAME, so `BUILD=80 make image` wrote
# OCTATRACK_OCTABAM80.bin whose panel said `BusVerb79` -- the file and the

# all (REVERB.md). So the moment the architecture lands, the delay loses its
# local render loop and goes back to one hardware flash per iteration, which is
# the expensive path this project exists to avoid.
#
# DEV=1 keeps all three servers real in BOTH payloads, so payload A's .mem dump
# always contains a driveable DELAY SERVER for tools/harness/send_probe.py.
#
# It pays for the space by taking CHORUS's module back as a fourth donor. That
# is 329 words immediately BELOW PLATE and contiguous with it (v98 gave it back
# because the product build no longer needed it). SEND + REVERB + a gated DELAY
# is 2744 words against the 2724 the three reverbs alone provide -- 20 over --
# so without this the hatch simply would not assemble under XBUS=1.
#
# Taking CHORUS costs FX1 its chorus, which is why this build is NEVER FLASHED:
# it writes out/mainos_bus_dev.bin, not out/mainos_bus.bin, and dumps the
# payload A .mem beside it.

# ---- SPEC=1: SPECIALIZE THE PAYLOADS ---------------------------------------
# One server per core. Payload A carries SEND + BusVerb; payload B carries
# SEND + BusDelay. Neither carries the other's engine.
#
# TRACK MAPPING -- MEASURED, 10 Aug 2026, and INVERTED from what every doc
# assumed: payload A serves TRACKS 5-8 and payload B serves TRACKS 1-4.
# Established by the MrkVerb32 marker flash: proc-entry marks fired on tracks
# 5-8 only (track 5 = position 0, full engine; 6-8 = duplicate-role rts).
# No pre-SPEC build could have revealed this -- both payloads carried every
# effect, so the mapping was unobservable. Deliberately NOT swapped: the
# reverb belongs downstream of the delay (delay wet -> reverb, series), so
# serving the delay from the low tracks is the wanted topology.
#
# WHY IT IS FREE. build_bus.py has always assembled and placed each payload
# independently -- its own `for tag, va, ln in PAYLOADS` pass, its own region,
# its own placement -- and the 2,724-word donor region is PER CORE. Both
# payloads carrying all three servers was never a requirement, only a habit.
# Dropping the engine each core does not run costs nothing and returns the
# region that engine occupied.
#
# IT ONLY MEANS ANYTHING WITH XBUS=1. The bus accumulators live at Y:0x900 in
# a plain build, which is CORE-PRIVATE low Y: one core's sends would write
# their own private copy, which the other core's server cannot see.
# Specializing without relocating the bus into the shared window does not
# build the target architecture, it builds "each half of the tracks reaches
# one effect and cannot send to the other" -- strictly worse than today, and
# it would look like it worked. So require the flag rather than silently
# producing that.
#
# THE ABSENT SERVER'S ID IS ALIASED TO SEND, deliberately (XBUS.md risk 3).
# The FX2 chooser is one ColdFire list shared by all eight tracks, so nothing
# stops a user selecting BusVerb on track 6. Its id must dispatch to
# SOMETHING on payload B; left alone it would run whatever code now occupies
# that address. Aliasing to SEND is the same fail-safe mechanism id 0 already
# uses, and it degrades in the useful direction: the track feeds the bus.

    # row, because it inherits the stock effect's (above, in place). What was
    # missing is a row for a module on a NEW id, and it was missing for one
    # mechanical reason: FX1's list ends at 0x400d608c and FX2's begins at
    # 0x400d6090, so it cannot grow where it is.

    # bytes of cave per row plus the relocated list. What it does cost is

    # The accumulators live at Y:0x900-0x9d2, which is CORE-PRIVATE low Y --
    # one core's sends write their own copy and the other core's server cannot
    # see it. Same address, different physical memory. Relocating them into the
    # shared 64K is the whole architectural change; everything else about the
    # bus is already written and hardware-proven.
    #
    # 0x36000 -- and the FIRST choice, 0x3E000, was WRONG. Hardware, 7 Aug:
    # the bus broke even SAME-CORE. The gate was provably inert in that test
    # (both effects were payload A, where it falls through), so the address was
    # the only remaining variable. Two things were wrong with it, and both are
    # checks that "the manual says the window is shared" let me skip:
    #
    #   * 0x3E000 is OUTSIDE the init pass. Init zeroes 0x30000-0x37FFF (32768
    #     words from 0x30000), so 0x3E000 comes up holding garbage.
    #   * payload A had never been shown to write there. dsp/alias_probe.asm
    #     tested payload A at 0x31000/0x33000/0x35000/0x37000 -- all the LOWER
    #     half. 0x38000-0x3FFFF was only ever exercised from payload B.
    #
    # 0x36000 fixes both: inside the zeroed region, and between two addresses
    # payload A has demonstrably written and read back. Still clear of stock's
    # per-frame staging (0x30000-0x30047, rewritten EVERY FRAME), both
    # bootstraps (0x31000/0x32000) and payload B's stub (0x38000), and still
    # its own 8K block (0x36000-0x37FFF) for the manual's "no bus contentions
    # when the two cores access different 8K blocks".
    #
    # NOTE for any real build: 0x36000 is inside core 0's FX2 SLOT 4
    # (0x34000-0x37FFF). Harmless while every core-0 track is BusVerb
    # (hardcoded Y:0x4000) or a SEND (zero-footprint), but it is not free
    # ground and BusDelay would contend for it.
    #
    # The map is mechanical: new = 0x3E000 + (old - 0x900), so the whole 0x900
    # -0x9d2 layout keeps its shape and all three files stay in agreement --

        # ---- ROTLATCH: resolve this block's write offset, per payload ------
        # THE SECOND CROSS-CORE DEFECT (docs/effects/XBUS.md step 3, hardware-confirmed
        # 17 Aug 2026). Every bus client used to read the shared rotation word
        # at its own dispatch time. Core 0 owns the flip, so core 0's clients --
        # dispatched right after the housekeeper -- always see the post-flip
        # value. Core 1's clients read it asynchronously, so whichever one's
        # execution window STRADDLES the flip sees the old rotation on some
        # blocks and the new one on others, and its contribution lands in an
        # already-consumed buffer half the time. Block-rate amplitude jitter:
        # broadband hash, linear in the send level, character invariant.
        #
        # Proven by changing track 5 -- core 0's POSITION 0, i.e. the
        # housekeeper -- from BusVerb to Send, which cured static on a core-1
        # path with nothing on core 1 touched.
        #
        # PAYLOAD A NEEDS NOTHING and pays 6 words for the uniform interface;
        # it is in lockstep with the flip by construction. PAYLOAD B tracks its
        # own rotation: advance exactly one step per block, and trust that
        # rather than the shared word unless the shared word says we are more
        # than one step out.
        #
        # ⚠️ THE KEEP CONDITION IS ASYMMETRIC ON PURPOSE. `S == R + one step`
        # is the pre-flip read -- the normal core-1 case, and the whole thing
        # we are immunising against -- so it keeps S. EVERYTHING else snaps to
        # R, which is what makes it self-healing: a client that misses a block
        # falls one behind, reads R == S + one step next block, and snaps.
        # 🟡 One state is stable and wrong: S stuck exactly one step AHEAD is
        # indistinguishable from a legitimate pre-flip read. It is harmless --
        # that client's audio lands in a buffer read one block (~0.36 ms) later
        # than everyone else's, CONSTANT rather than jittering, and never in
        # the buffer being read. Constant offsets are inaudible; jitter is not.
        # It cannot arise in the emulator (single core, always post-flip, S
        # tracks R exactly from the first block), which is what keeps the
        # bit-identity gate meaningful.
        #
        # ⚠️ ASSUMES THE CORES ARE RATE-LOCKED and merely phase-offset. If they
        # can actually drift, "advance one per block" diverges and this needs a
        # real elastic buffer instead. UNVERIFIED -- no local test can reach it.
        # ⚠️ THE ROTATION WORD'S ADDRESS MUST BE SPELLED RELOCATED HERE.
        # This substitution runs INSIDE the payload loop, which is AFTER the
        # XBUS pass has already rewritten every `$9xx` literal in the source to
        # XBUS_BASE + 0x9xx. Text inserted now is not seen by that pass, so a
        # bare `$900` in the body below would read CORE-PRIVATE Y:0x900 instead
        # of the shared rotation -- resolving the offset to zero on every block
        # while the housekeeper rotates, which silently breaks every client.
        # Cost the first build of this fix an hour; the bus gate caught it as
        # nine dead renders. Same family as every other blanket-substitution
        # trap in CLAUDE.md.
        # ⚠️ AND THE MAP IS `base + (old - 0x900)`, NOT `base + old`. The whole
        # 0x900..0x9ff page relocates onto XBUS_BASE..+0xff, so the rotation
        # word -- $900, the first word of the page -- lands on XBUS_BASE
        # EXACTLY. Adding the full 0x900 pointed at unowned memory 0x900 words
