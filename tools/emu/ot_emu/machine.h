// The Octatrack as a machine, headless: one ColdFire MCF54454 and (later) two
// DSP56300 cores, driven from a script and open to interception.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `tools/emu/emu_rtos.py` (route A) already runs the firmware's
// own scheduler on Unicorn + Python, and it is the ORACLE this port is
// measured against -- but it costs ~120x real time, models no audio, and
// stops at the DSP host port. `tools/harness/dsp_host` runs both DSP cores at about
// real time but knows nothing of the ColdFire. This is the join: the same
// machine, in one process, fast enough to play with.
//
// It is deliberately NOT a plugin. No JUCE, no UI, no audio device. The
// deliverable is a library plus a CLI you can drive and intercept -- the
// C++ counterpart of route A's Python API.
//
// MILESTONE O1 (this file's only job so far): boot the OS image to the RTOS
// handoff -- the `trap #0` at 0x4000ff9a that hands control to the kernel --
// with the same registers route A reaches. Everything below is the minimum
// that boot touches, taken FIELD FOR FIELD from `tools/emu/emu_bringup.py` so the
// two can be diffed rather than argued about:
//
//   * the RAM map (six regions, `emu_bringup.boot`)
//   * SR = 0x2700 and A7 = 0x48000000 before the first instruction, SR FIRST
//     (the supervisor/user stack banks swap on the SR write, so writing A7
//     first lands it in the wrong bank -- route A's comment, kept because the
//     failure is silent)
//   * peripheral reads default to ALL-ONES, which satisfies every
//     wait-until-set spin in the boot path
//   * the PLL at 0xfc0c4000 must read (reg >> 24) * 12 MHz == 264 MHz or the
//     firmware halts at 0x4000fa8c -- so the top byte is 22
//
// ⚠️ WHAT IS KNOWN MISSING, and why it is fine for O1: the vendored Musashi
// implements ColdFire V2 (MCF5206E, ISA_A) and this chip is V4e. Every
// `mvs`/`mvz`/`mov3q`/`byterev`/`ff1` and the whole EMAC are absent, so the
// boot will stop at the first one. That is the point: the illegal-instruction
// report below names the opcode and the PC, which is a work list, not a bug.
