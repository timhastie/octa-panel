// The CompactFlash card behind the FlexBus task-file window at 0x90000000.
//
// Translated from `tools/emu/emu_card.py`'s `AtaCard`, which is the specification.
// ⚠️ THE FAT16 IMAGE BUILDER IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. Route A builds the card
// image from a directory tree in Python (`emu_card.build_image`), and that is
// a BUILD-TIME tool producing bytes, not machine behaviour: this port reads
// the same image file, so the two emulators are guaranteed to be looking at
// identical media and any difference between them is in the machine. Build one
// with `emu_rtos.stage_project(...)`.
//
// The register map is docs/firmware/ARCHITECTURE.md §5: data 0xa0, features/error 0xa4,
// count 0xa8, LBA 0xac/b0/b4, device 0xb8, command/status 0xbc, alt status
// 0xd8. IDENTIFY advertises PIO only (word 49 bit 8 clear, word 53 zero), so
// the driver's variant detection at 0x40015e28 never programs the on-chip DMA
// channel -- which is why this model never has to.
