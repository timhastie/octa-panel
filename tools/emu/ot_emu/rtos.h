// The machine RUNNING: the firmware's own scheduler, its tasks, its timers.
//
// This is the C++ counterpart of `tools/emu/emu_rtos.py`'s `Rtos` class, and route
// A is the oracle (`docs/firmware/COLDFIRE_PORT.md`). Everything here is a translation
// of a named piece of that file, with its measurements and its warnings
// carried across rather than summarised.
//
// ⚠️ ONE DELIBERATE DIFFERENCE FROM ROUTE A, and it is the only one: route A
// hand-rolls exception entry and exit (`_push`, `_pop`) because Unicorn's
// CFV4E will not dispatch them -- its VBR is a no-op and its `rte` never
// arrives. The vendored Musashi DOES both: `m68ki_stack_frame_0000` has the
// ColdFire 2-longword frame (format `4 | A7[1:0]`, vector, SR, then PC --
// MCF5206e UM 3.4) and `m68ki_jump_vector` reads REG_VBR, which the firmware
// sets itself with a `movec %a0,%vbr` at 0x40000db6. So this port lets the
// CPU take its own exceptions, which is the hardware mechanism rather than a
// model of it. The oracle diff is what proves the two agree; if it ever
// disagrees, THAT is the finding, and the hand-rolled path is the fallback.
//
// Time is counted in SAMPLES, as route A counts it, because the two clocks the
// firmware cares about are fixed ratios of the sample clock. Instructions per
// sample (`ips`) is a knob with a default, not a truth.
