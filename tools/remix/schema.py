"""What a remix module declares about itself.

A *module* is one contribution to the firmware: an FX2 engine, a bus client,
a ColdFire behaviour patch, or a combination. A *remix* is a named selection
of modules composed into one image. This file is the vocabulary both sides
speak.

The point of a typed manifest here is not tidiness. Almost every expensive
failure this project has had was two mechanisms disagreeing about one effect
-- a descriptor that drew a knob publishing nothing, a formatter inherited
from a donor overriding the value count it was given, a knob-to-slot map
copied into six files and stale in four. A manifest is the one place those
facts are written down, so a contributor states them once and the build,
the checks and the harness all read the same statement.

WHAT IS CONSUMED TODAY. This schema is deliberately narrower than the full
architecture: it declares what the build actually reads right now. Resource
claims (Y regions, r7 slots, cave ranges) and the ColdFire patch type get
their fields when the ledger that checks them exists -- a declared-but-
unchecked claim is worse than no claim, because it reads like a guarantee.

# ---- the fallback that is not a module -------------------------------------
# An unimplemented id has to dispatch SOMEWHERE, and the answer has always
# been a module of ours -- SEND, which passes the audio through and only taps
# it. That costs 215-250 words, and an INSERT-ONLY remix was paying them for
# a client nothing reads: with no server in the image, nothing ever consumes
# the bus accumulators SEND writes. restock.py says so in its own docstring
# -- PLATE REV is missing from it ONLY because SEND's words land on PLATE's.
#
# So a remix may name this sentinel instead, and unimplemented ids resolve to
# the FIRMWARE's own NONE: its descriptor (the one at list position 0 of a
# stock FX2 chooser, which our rebuilt list otherwise drops) and, on the DSP
# side, the per-payload null stub the build already points silenced donor ids
# at. It costs one list row -- four bytes of cave -- and no words at all.
#
# ⚠️ IT IS REFUSED BESIDE ANY BUS PARTICIPANT, and that is the whole safety
# argument. Housekeeping -- flipping the rotation word and clearing the
# accumulators, once per block -- is gated to payload A and done by the FIRST
# CORE-0 PARTICIPANT DISPATCHED that block (send_client.asm's `bus_seen`
# election). Today every unassigned track runs SEND, so core 0 always has
# one. Under this fallback an unassigned track runs nothing, so a project
# with tracks 5-8 all unassigned has no housekeeper -- and a server on the
# OTHER core then reads an accumulator that is never rotated and never
# cleared. With no server and no client in the image there is no bus, no
# rotation and nothing to clear, so the question does not arise. That is the
# only case this is allowed in; registry.remix() enforces it.
#
# ⚠️ AND IT CANNOT BE SETTLED LOCALLY EITHER WAY: dsp_host is single-core, so
# no local test can reproduce a bus timing defect (CLAUDE.md). The refusal is
# what keeps the question off the table rather than answered by inference.

    patch, say) may sit anywhere in the list; they are filtered out where a
    chooser order is wanted.

    STOCK effects are listed by the same keys ("FILTER", "CHORUS", ...):
    tools/remix/stock.py. A stock effect NOT listed is not removed from the
    image -- its code, descriptor and dispatch stay stock, so an old project

    what every remix did to all fourteen of them before 2 Sep 2026. Only
    the three reverbs are actually consumed (their code is the donor region
    every module packs into) and they cannot be listed.

    THE FALLBACK IS NOT OPTIONAL, and it is the question a selective build

    it runs whatever code now occupies the address. Pointing it at a module
    that passes audio degrades in the useful direction, which is why the
    default is the send client: a track that selects a missing effect becomes

    # THE OTHER HALF OF "BOTH SLOTS", and it belongs to the REMIX rather than

    # the panel side, which stock keeps in FX1's own tables.

    # relocated into the cave (it ends at 0x400d608c with FX2's beginning at
    # 0x400d6090, so it cannot grow in place -- tools/build/build_fx1.py proved the
    # move standalone against the stock image). What it does cost is CYCLES:
    # an FX1 effect runs on a track that is already running an FX2 one, so
    # the worst per-core load can gain four more copies of it. cycle_count.py
    # prices that, and the remixer's Budget row is where to look first.
    #
    # ⚠️ A `replaces` MODULE IS ALREADY ON FX1 and must not be listed here:
    # it inherits the stock effect's row and has both of FX1's tables
    # repointed in place, so a second row would list it twice.
    #
    # ⚠️ ONLY A BUFFER-FREE INSERT MAY TAKE ONE. `state.fx1_hazard()` is the
    # single statement of why, read by both the remixer and build_bus.py, and
    # it refuses three classes:
    #
    #   * A module that reads the host's allocator (`x:>$213`). FX1 and FX2
    #     keep SEPARATE allocator tables at different sizes (measured, X:0x255
    #     in both payloads): an FX2 slot is 16,384 words, an FX1 slot 3,072.
    #     ⚠️ This is not theoretical and it is not new -- docs/firmware/DSP.md's "wrong
    #     claim 1" is this exact failure, bisected on hardware: a 16K layout
    #     at an FX1 base "runs to 0x53ff, through the other FX1 buffers and
    #     into FX2 slot 0". NIMBUS LITE reads the allocator and IS exposed;
    #     an earlier draft of this comment claimed nothing was, which was
    #     wrong -- it had checked only the fixed-base modules.
    #   * A module with FIXED buffers in the FX2 region (BusVerb, Nimbus,
    #     BusDelay). An FX1 instance still writes to Y:0x4000 and up, i.e.
    #     into some other track's FX2 buffer. The hazard exists on FX2 too --
    #     it is why Nimbus is documented "one per core" -- but an FX1 row
    #     doubles the slots it can be reached from, a second instance on the
    #     SAME track included.
    #   * A bus SERVER, which is one per core by design (SPEC places one
    #     engine per payload). A second instance on a core is the open
    #     "duplicate instances corrupt audio after ~5.45 s" item.
    #
    # What is left is exactly the INSERT class: WarpFold, Ripple, Rungs,
    # Streamz, BodeShift, Hello World -- and SEND, which is buffer-free
    # (untested there, but nothing measured argues against it).
    # PLACED BUT NOT LISTED. Each key here is carried by the image -- code,
    # id, descriptor clone -- and takes NO CHOOSER ROW, with its twelve
    # parameter names blanked so the track page it lands on draws no knobs.
    #
    # This is how an effect stops being a per-track choice and becomes part
    # of the instrument: the two bus engines are hosted by the project stamp,
    # not by turning a chooser, and their controls live on a main-menu screen
    # instead of a track page (docs/firmware/MAINMENU.md section 6). Blanking the
    # NAMES is what empties the page: the parameter COUNTS and enable bits
    # stay, so the stock parameter writer still clamps and commits every slot
    # and the frame builder still carries it to the DSP -- measured in the
    # emulator, 4 Sep 2026, both halves (the page drew nothing; the writer
    # landed a value in the Part).

    # the plain `bus` image's chooser too, from three rows to one. A remix
    # hides an engine only when it also carries the screen that edits it.
    #
    # ⚠️ IT DOES NOT MAKE THE ID PRIVATE. Dispatch is per id and shared by
