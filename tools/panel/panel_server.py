"""The virtual front panel: the emulated unit with a clickable UI.

Serves a browser page that shows the firmware's REAL screen -- the LCD
framebuffer the draw primitives paint at FB (found 10 Sep 2026 by hooking
memory writes from the draw-primitive region during a menu draw: 16
bytes/row, MSB left, 128x64) -- and injects key presses through the
firmware's own per-key jump table (KEY_TABLE, RTOS_FORK.md section 9), the
same path `press_key_live` proved against the M6c fidelity gate.

Two emulator backends (12 Sep 2026), the same Panel code over either:

  * `port`  -- the C++ ColdFire port, `out/emu/ot_emu --interactive`, over
    pipes (PortProc/PortRt below; protocol in the PortProc docstring). The
    default when the binary exists: boot + the fixture project in 21 s wall
    (route A ~95 s), 350 emulated ms per wall s while playing (route A
    60-100; measured 12 Sep 2026), and it loads the project itself during
    its boot. Missing binary: built here; a build
    that fails, or a binary without --interactive, falls back to route A
    with the reason in /status "backend_note".
  * `routea` -- emu_rtos (Unicorn): the real scheduler, so the UI task
    consumes what a key handler posts and repaints -- a handler called under
    route B changes state but nothing redraws (measured: 15 handlers, zero
    framebuffer changes). --backend routea, or the fallback.

    .venv/bin/python3 tools/panel/panel_server.py                  # built image, empty card
    .venv/bin/python3 tools/panel/panel_server.py --image out/raw/section_3_MAIN_OS.bin
    .venv/bin/python3 tools/panel/panel_server.py --project <dir> [--set S] [--name N]
    .venv/bin/python3 tools/panel/panel_server.py --backend routea   # the Python oracle
    .venv/bin/python3 tools/panel/panel_server.py --project <dir> --audio ~/samples   # seed the pool

Samples (12 Sep 2026): the card's AUDIO folder is a per-port pool
(SamplePool, out/_panel_pool_<port>/) -- /samples/add, /samples/upload
and /samples/remove change it, /samples/commit rebuilds the card and
reboots the unit on it (there is no hot-plug: Panel.commit_card).

Sound (12 Sep 2026): with `--sound on` (the default) the port child runs
--dsp and the server drains core 0's main L/R over the pipe (O14k) into
AudioRing (the last 180 s, absolute frame numbers) and, from PLAY to STOP,
into out/_panel_takes_<port>/take-NNN.wav -- /audio/status, /audio/pcm,
/audio.wav, /audio/enable (README "Hearing the unit"). Playing costs ~3x
the wall time of a child without the cores.

The card (13 Sep 2026, O19): `--card <file.img>` boots an EXISTING image
as it is, with the child's write-back on (`--card-rw`: every sector the
firmware writes lands in the file), so the unit's own SAVE PROJECT and the
samples put on the card survive a quit -- the file is the card. A missing
file is created once from --project (the per-port build below) with a
sidecar `<file.img>.json` (set / project names, pending removals); later
boots read the sidecar. The pool is then `<file.img>.pool/` (pending
additions, never wiped); /samples/commit copies it onto the card through
an hdiutil mount while the child is stopped (no rebuild); /card/eject
mounts the card on the Mac for Finder and /card/insert boots it again.
Without --card nothing changes: a fresh per-port image every start.

    .venv/bin/python3 tools/panel/panel_server.py --card out/cards/OTLIVE-PROJECT.img \
        --project out/_projects/otlive/OTLIVE/PROJECT --set OTLIVE --name PROJECT

Then open http://localhost:8563/. Unmapped keys: the MAP drawer lists every
table entry; click one, watch the screen, name it. The mapping lives in the
browser (localStorage) and exports as JSON -- send a completed map back as
a PR to key_map.json.

The output device (13 Sep 2026): /audio/devices lists the Mac's audio
devices (PortAudio via the sounddevice package), /audio/output?device=
<index|name|off> streams the unit's outputs to one of them in real time
(main L/R on channels 1-2, cue L/R on 3-4, and -- O23, per-track outputs
the hardware does not have -- tracks 1-8 as stereo stems on 5-20, then
the other four ESAI words on 21-24; a device with fewer channels gets the
first pairs, a 2-channel one main L/R) -- BlackHole into a DAW, or the
speakers -- and /audio/status "output" says how it is going (README
"Recording into a DAW"). With a device on, the child streams the eight
ESAI words plus the eight stems (`audio start tracks`, 24 words a frame;
`all` on an older child) and the drain de-interleaves main L/R for the
ring, the takes and /audio/pcm, which see exactly what they saw.

# `emu` extra of pyproject.toml carries it -- `uv sync --extra emu`, or into
# an existing venv `uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python3 sounddevice`)
# on the device the user picks, fed from the same drain as the ring and the
# takes. With a device on, the child's capture runs `audio start tracks`
# (O23, 13 Sep 2026): the EIGHT ESAI words per frame (O14k: words 2/3 = main
# L/R, 4/5 = cue L/R, 0/1 and 6/7 whatever the DSP puts there, zero on the
# fixture) followed by the EIGHT PER-TRACK STEMS (T1 L, T1 R, ... T8 L,
# T8 R: each track's own term of the DSP's main mix, tapped inside the
# emulator's mixdown -- COLDFIRE_PORT.md O23), 24 words a frame; an older
# child without `tracks` gets `all` (8 words). The drain de-interleaves main
# L/R for the ring, the takes and /audio/pcm -- byte for byte what `audio
# start main` gives -- and hands the whole frame to the output, which lays
# it out on the device as main L/R -> channels 1-2, cue L/R -> 3-4, tracks
# 1-8 -> 5-20 (T1 on 5-6 ... T8 on 19-20), words 0/1 -> 21-22, words 6/7 ->
# 23-24, as many of those pairs as the device has channels for (a 2-channel
# device gets main L/R, an 8-channel one main, cue and tracks 1-2, BlackHole
# 16ch main, cue and tracks 1-6). The stream is opened with exactly that
# many channels, so anything further on the device is silent. The PortAudio callback (its own thread) pulls from a
# deque of chunks: it plays nothing until OUTPUT_PRIME_S is queued, puts out
# zeros and counts an underrun when the queue runs dry (then primes again),
# and the push drops the OLDEST frames beyond OUTPUT_CAP_S queued so the
# latency stays bounded -- counted as `dropped` while the stream plays (an
# audible skip) and as `trimmed` while it is re-priming after a gap (the
# fresh child's boot burst after a reboot: nothing was due, nothing heard). Two clocks -- the child's pacer (44,100
# frames per wall second) and the device's own -- so a long session drifts
# by their difference and shows it as an underrun or a drop now and then.

# every PortAudio call is caught, a device that goes away stops the stream

#
# With --card the image file IS the card: the child boots it with --card-rw
# (AtaCard::setWriteBack: every sector the firmware writes is pwrite()n to
# the file as the WRITE completes), so SAVE PROJECT on the unit lands in it
# and the next boot on the same file finds it. What the server needs of the
# card without a mount -- the AUDIO folder's listing, the sets and projects
# for the sidecar -- comes from Fat16Image below, a read-only walk of the
# FAT16 volume the builder writes (emu_card._Fat16: MBR + one partition at
# LBA 2048, 512-byte sectors, LFN entries). Changing the card goes through
# an hdiutil mount (card_attach / card_detach), ONLY while the child is
# stopped: a re-insert copies the pool's pending files into <SET>/AUDIO
# and deletes the marked ones; an eject leaves it mounted for Finder.

        empty it advances emulated time in 10 ms slices so that it tracks
        its own wall clock (sleeping inside poll() on stdin when ahead, so
        a command wakes it at once; flat out when the core is slower than
        real time; re-anchoring past 250 ms of lag) -- and this thread
        only serves the actions and, every PACE_POLL_S when none is
        queued, drains tx and audio, reads `pacestatus` and renders. No
        `run` from the loop at all. What that replaces: the 25 ms pump +
        30 ms sleep ran idle at 0.69x without the cores and 1.02x in
        bursts of 0.85-2.0x with them (the firmware's clocks neither at
        hardware rate nor steady), and the SLOW_PUMP hack that compressed
        0.45 s of wall into 191 emulated ms after a track key so a page
        double-click could land. Now the double-tap window is a wall-time
        property: two page clicks 0.15 s apart open the slot list, 0.30 s
        apart miss (doubletap.py, 12 Sep 2026), as on the unit. Actions
        still run their own `run`s (a key's 50 ms); those advance on top
        of the pacer, which then waits for the wall clock, so the
        emulated timing around a click is the same as before and the wall
        timing is the unit's. Measured: idle 1.000x +- 0.01 with and
        without --dsp at ~8 % / ~40 % of a core (the DSP cores do not
        idle-skip); playing flat out until the core is >= 1.0x (no --dsp:
