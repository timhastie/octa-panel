"""octatrick -- SYNTH MACHINE + SCALE QUANTIZER + DIRECT JUMP on the stock
effects, no octabam DSP code.

Tim Hastie's three ColdFire modules (github.com/timhastie/octatrick) ported
onto upstream octabam (25 Sep 2026): the SYNTH machine (a FLEX track whose
sample is named SYNTH*.wav plays a two-operator FM voice; its LFO page's VOIC
slot makes it paraphonic, chord shapes from CHRD snapped onto SCALE), the
SCALE and GLIDE rows in PROJECT > CONTROL > SEQUENCER (the PTCH knob and
CHROMATIC keys quantized to a scale; the synth's glide time and 303-style
legato on the keys), and the pattern change option (CHAIN AFTER = DIRECT, its
unused value 1). The voice engine is a DRAM unit in the platform reserve (10
MB off the audio page arena); the page, the quantizer and direct-jump caves
are ROM.

The fourteen stock effects are listed as modules with fallback NONE, the
way usb-lean keeps a stock chooser: both DSP payloads, their dispatch and
the chooser's rows stay stock (the list is rebuilt at the long-list address
with the same fifteen rows), so every stock effect stays selectable and
every existing project plays as it did. Build with `make image
REMIX=octatrick BUILD=N`. octatrick-usb adds USB MIDI + USB AUDIO.
